I'm Piper Thunstrom, a career Python developer and a games enthusiast. Games
were my introduction to programming. I wasn't a modder, I went from learning 
python syntax and the pygame library with a handful of books and built my first
arcade style shooter a month later.

Since then, terrible games have been my excuse to push my programming limits a
little further. From teaching myself trigonometry and linear algebra to make
my shooters use mouse controls to building an MVC framework from scratch just
to better understand how MVC works, games are my hack space. My latest project
is a game engine in Python.
