So, we've covered more or less all you need to get started with games, now to
expand on my second point: Games provide you a test space that is almost
endlessly deep to experiment in.

I, personally, have used games as a place to learn more complex software
engineering principles. For a pyweek one year, I used a handful of tutorials
and a lot of experimentation to build an MVC framework for a little RPG project.

I didn't finish the game, but I did have a functioning framework at the end.

So if anyone is familiar with this book:

    Programming Patterns

There's a similar one that's a really great read:

    Game Programming Patterns

There's a lot of material in these two that can be applied directly to video
games. And once you're done there, you can start trying to optimize your games,
which means experimenting with your algorithms to make your choke points faster.

And as you become more familiar with your favored tools, you can even start
identifying ways to improve the tools you use. I've submitted a few bugs to
Pygame over the years where the API didn't work they claimed it did.
