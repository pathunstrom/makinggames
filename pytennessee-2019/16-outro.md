If you have any questions:
* find me in the hall
* tweet me @pathunstrom,
* email me at pathunstrom@gmail.com

You can find my talk notes on github at pathunstrom/making-games.

You can find the source to `ppb` at github.com/ppb.
Contributions encouraged, we need docs, examples, tests, and we're
working on a new back end.

Thanks everyone for your time!
