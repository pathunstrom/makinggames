I want to inspire you to make games.

I'll show you that games are simple to get started with.

I'll show you that they have nearly infinite depth for experimentation.

I'll show you that failure, when you're using them to learn or as a hobby,
is effectively free.

At the end of all of this, I'll provide some resources you should check out
when you decide to continue.
