I'm Piper Thunstrom, a career Python developer and a games enthusiast. Games
were my introduction to programming. I didn't modify video games like some 
people, I went from learning python syntax and the pygame library with a 
handful of books and built my first arcade style shooter a month later.

Since then, terrible games have been my excuse to push my programming limits a
little further. From teaching myself trigonometry and linear algebra in order
to make my shooters use mouse controls to building an MVC framework from
scratch just to better understand how MVC works, games are my hack space. My
latest project is a game engine in Python.
