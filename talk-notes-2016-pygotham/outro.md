So that's it. Making games is a great place to challenge yourself. You get 
great feedback from watching your code do something, you're going to have a 
lot of complex problems to solve, and games are fun.

You can get Pygame at pygame.org, PySDL2's docs are at pysdl2.readthedocs.io 
and can be downloaded via pip.

PursuedPyBear is at github.com/pathunstrom/pursuedpybear and can be installed 
with `pip install ppb`. It is open to pull requests.

You can find me at pathunstrom on twitter.

I am planning on grabbing an hour in the birds of a feather room for anyone 
that wants to hack together a game project.
