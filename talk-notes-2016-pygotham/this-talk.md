So let's talk about games.

Things I intend to cover:

The basic code structure of a video game. If you're not even sure where to start, 
this is where you want to pay attention.

Beginner anti-patterns. There are a lot of habits that most books teach that 
you'll need to unlearn to make better games. I'll point them out and offer
alternatives.

After that, we'll get into project structure and design decisions. I'll talk a 
bit about a couple of game libraries I have experience with and talk about the 
patterns unique to each.

Then we can discuss building a proper framework.
