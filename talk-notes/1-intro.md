I'm Piper Thunstrom:

* software developer at GLG
* author of PursuedPyBear, a python game framework
* games enthusiast.

I've been an enthusiast for as long as I can remember.
Tabletop, video games, LARP, you name it, I've probably tried it.
That clearly doesn't stop at _playing_ games.
I used to experiment with my brother and build card games.
I build board games as class assignments.
When I started programming, I started building video games.

I can confidently state that video games are why I'm a developer today.
I jumped in feet first, and used games as a platform to learn.
I learned some math I didn't get in school, like trig, calc, and
linear algebra.
I've taught myself physics to better model games.
I even spent a week learning the ins and outs of fireworks for a game I
wanted to build.

On top of all of that, though: I was learning software engineering.
